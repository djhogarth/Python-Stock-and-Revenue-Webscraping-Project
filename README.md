# Python Stock and Revenue Webscraping Project

For this project, I will roleplay as a Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks.
My task is to extract data such as historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings financial data from various sources using Python libraries
and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, a dashboard will be used to identify patterns or trends. 
The stocks used in this project are Tesla GameStop.
